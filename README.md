# Play SDK
![Play hero image](playToXcode.jpg)

## Play overview
[Play](https://createwithplay.com/) is a visual platform for designing interactive iOS apps. It allows you to use real iOS views to build and prototype your ideas and see them live on your device.

With Play 3.0, the **PlaySDK** enables developers to export Play designs as production-ready code. Play generates highly performant native UIKit or SwiftUI code that integrates seamlessly with Xcode and can be safely shipped to production. The PlaySDK makes all of your Play styles, components, and assets accessible inside Xcode and the rest of your app. With **Play + PlaySDK**, anyone can design and build apps inside the Play app, export their work, and ship it to the App Store or integrate it into their existing iOS project.

## Requirements

- Currently, this SDK supports a minimum iOS version of **17.4+**.
- The SDK is tested and developed using Xcode **16.2**.
- The package uses Swift Tools Version **5.8** and does not yet support Swift 6.

## Getting started
The library is distributed through Swift Package Manager

To get started with Play SDK, check out the following resources:

- [Getting Started with Play SDK](https://createwithplay.com/playsdk/getting-started)

### Quick Start
To quickly see how PlaySDK works and how it can be embedded into an iOS app, check out the **example project** included in the repository. This project demonstrates how to integrate Play components and pages into an Xcode project.

1. Clone the PlaySDK repository.
2. Open the `Examples/` folder.
3. Run the example project in Xcode to explore PlaySDK in action.

This example provides a hands-on look at how PlaySDK translates Play designs into a functional iOS app.

You can get started with PlaySDK without having previously opened or used the Play application, though you may find it useful to install it to open Play files before exporting them. You can [download it here](https://createwithplay.com/).

### How do I import my Play project into my existing app?

During the export process, Play gives you the option to add your project to an existing app. Simply hit **Publish**, then **Export New Project**, and instead of creating a new project, select an existing Xcode project.

Play will automatically add the necessary packages and entitlements to your existing project.

#### Using a Play Component in your existing application



##### SwiftUI
You can instantiate a component in your existing application by importing your package. 
```
var body: some View {
    VStack(spacing: 16) {
        
        // Add the component from Play SDK
        Chip()
        
        // Set the Component's state (this component has 2 states: 'defaultState' & 'selected')
            .state(currentState)
        
        // Do something when the state changes
        // Tap the button to change its state
            .onStateChange { state in
                currentState = state
                withAnimation() { isToggled.toggle() }
            }
    }
}
```

##### UIKit

```
override func viewDidLoad() {
  super.viewDidLoad()
  // Add the component from Play SDK
  let myComponent = Chip()
  myComponent.translatesAutoresizingMaskIntoConstraints = false
  view.addSubview(myComponent)
  
  NSLayoutConstraint.activate([
      myComponent.centerXAnchor.constraint(equalTo: view.centerXAnchor),
      myComponent.centerYAnchor.constraint(equalTo: view.centerYAnchor)
  ])
  
  // Set the Component's state (this component has 2 states: 'defaultState' & 'selected')
  myComponent.state(.selected)
  
  // Do something when the state changes
  // Tap the button to change its state.
  myComponent.onStateChange = { [weak self] animation in
      self?.isToggled.toggle()
      changeBackgroundColor()
  }
}
```

Check out the `Examples/` folder and the [PlaySDK Documentation](https://createwithplay.com/playsdk/) for more examples of how to work with the PlaySDK.
